# Byte Wave Technology
================

## Overview
------------

Well, this project was basically a failed startup idea. Me and one of my buddy planned on starting something. Well let's say, it didn't go as planned. Initially, we started up with discussing the outcome, workflow and what not. We ended up planning a lot and believe me, when i say, a lot, i mean it. 

We planned on creating a platform where people could build a trust and foundation to their small business. We thought, it would be a good thing to create a stunning website which could showcase out services. Well, guess what, it was the worst decision i've ever made. 

We started off with conducting weekly meetings discussing the progress on the project. I ended up working off on the project for over a month straight. Just imagining it gives me chills. But i wasn't sure if i should backup everything on GitHub. This was the second worst decision.

I completed the project, i completed the full fledge website. I was planning on integrating the Payment method to the website.That's when i was struck by a thunder bolt, my BIOS corrupted! I didn't took it well. I started searching here and there to try to recover the files but my laptop won't start up. I was completely devastated when i found out that the HDD was corrupted. Everything fell apart and i asked my mate to continue working on the project and try to complete the code until i find a fix for my PC. But he couldn't work on the project, not sure if he was already planning to separate but i guess, it is what it is right?

Well, here i am, after fixing my laptop, working back on the project to make it work. You can also contribute to this project, Do check out below for more.
